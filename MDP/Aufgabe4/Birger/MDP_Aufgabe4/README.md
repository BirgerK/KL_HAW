# Simulation of Elevator-Scheduling
This python-project simulates the scheduling of multiple elevators which gets elevator-calls over the whole simulation-time.

## Install dependencies
In the project-root is a `requirements.txt` given. This applies all necessary python-dependencies. For using this, please change working-dir to project-root and execute `pip install -r requirements.txt`. `pip` should be given if python is already installed locally. If python is not installed, please install it for your OS.

## Run simulation
If dependencies are installed, you can run the simulation on your terminal.

For this run from the working-dir (or anywhere else) the command `python src/start_sim.py`. Now you'll see the curses-interface and the elevators getting and executing calls. If simulation is done, you'll get matplotlib-statistics.

Enjoy!
